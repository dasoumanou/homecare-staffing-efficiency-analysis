# Homecare Staffing Efficiency Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes homecare staffing data to evaluate how efficiently caregiver shifts are scheduled and completed. The goal is to identify gaps between scheduled and actual hours, uncover inefficiencies such as cancellations and no-shows, and provide actionable recommendations to reduce labor cost waste.

## Business Problem
Homecare agencies face rising labor costs and operational challenges due to missed shifts, overtime, and unreliable scheduling. Leadership needs clear visibility into staffing performance to make informed operational decisions.

## Data Description
The dataset includes shift-level staffing information such as caregiver and client assignments, scheduled vs actual hours, shift status, pay rates, regions, and shift types. Additional calculated fields were created to measure completion rates, overtime hours, and inefficiency costs.

## Key KPIs
- Total Scheduled Hours  
- Total Actual Hours  
- Completion Rate  
- Overtime Hours  
- Inefficiency Hours  
- Cost of Inefficiency  

## Key Insights
- Actual hours consistently fell below scheduled hours due to cancellations and no-shows.
- A small subset of caregivers accounted for a disproportionate number of missed shifts.
- Certain regions generated higher inefficiency costs, indicating localized operational issues.
- Overtime occurred despite overall underutilization, suggesting scheduling inefficiencies.

## Recommendations
- Track caregiver reliability metrics to reduce no-shows.
- Reallocate staffing in high-inefficiency regions.
- Review overtime allocation policies.
- Use the dashboard for weekly operational reviews.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Power BI

## Deliverable
An interactive Power BI dashboard providing leadership with visibility into staffing efficiency, cost leakage, and caregiver performance.
